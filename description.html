               <p>Space Invaders is a Japanese shooting video game released in 1978 by Taito. It was developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who was inspired by other media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The games was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video game industry from a novelty to a global industry.</p>
               <p>The game Space Invaders became an immediate hit when it was released in 1978. In the original planning for the game, they had planned to have the aliens be human soldiers. Taito figured that they did not want to send the message that shooting humans was ok, so they changed it to aliens.</p>

               <p> This website is part of a project that aims to bring the wonderful game of Space Invaders to the "Alexandru Ioan Cuza" University. </p>
    <p> This project was created by Vl&abreve;du&tcedil; Cojocariu, Sabina S&abreve;vescu and Andrei Arhip,
        under the guidance of their professor Cosmin Varlan. </p>
        <p> This project aims to recreate the legendary game of Space Invaders, but with a twist: the levels are inspired by the computer science building layout, the users will be able to connect using various social accounts, the bosses are professors and a whole lot more. </p>
